# ReservSys

## Overview
This project, developed for the Programming Lab II course at Kocaeli University, is a reservation system designed for different transportation companies. It enables entrepreneurial passengers to make reservations from various transportation firms, including railway, road, and airway options.

## Project Duration
- **Start Date:** November 7, 2023
- **End Date:** December 1, 2023

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to help students understand object-oriented programming and problem-solving. The implementation should be in C++, C#, or JAVA. The project involves creating a reservation system within the application interface.

## Features
1. **Admin Panel:**
   - Login with username and password.
   - View existing companies.
   - Add new companies.
   - Delete company records.
   - Set service fee (fixed at 1000).

2. **Company Panel:**
   - Login with username and password.
   - Manage vehicles and routes.
   - Calculate daily profits considering passenger fares, service fees, staff costs, and fuel costs.

3. **User Panel:**
   - Direct login.
   - Search for available transport options.
   - Make reservations for multiple passengers on selected routes.
   - Pay for reservations and receive confirmation.

## Implementation Details
- Object-oriented design using classes and interfaces.
- UML diagram is mandatory for the project.
- Use of NYP structures as specified.
- Clear demonstration of reservation system steps.
- Consistent adherence to NYP principles.
- Consideration of user interface design.

## Project Structure
The project involves the following classes:
- User (abstract class)
  - Admin
  - Company
  - Customer
- Vehicle (abstract class)
  - Bus
  - Train
  - Airplane
- Trip
- Route
- Person (abstract class)

  - Implementation of interfaces: ILoginable, IReservable, IProfitable

## Notes
- Complete class and variable definitions as specified.
- Implementation of reservation system adhering to all rules.
- Use of NYP structures, with flexibility for additional class definitions.
- Clear presentation of all steps in the reservation system.
- Non-compliance with NYP logic will result in partial evaluation.
- Interface design is expected.
- Each group member's contributions must be specified in the report.

## Project Submission
- UML diagram is mandatory.
- IEEE format report  covering abstract, introduction, method, contributions, conclusion, and references.
- Individual contributions of each group member.
